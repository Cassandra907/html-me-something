       <h2> North Charleston, South Carolina</h2>
       <p>I was born in Charleston in July of 1990 and only lived there until September 1991. I was too young to enjoy everything Charelston has to offer but I would one day like to visit and take a tour of the Old Jail. The former Charleston District Jail, also knows as the Old Jail, was built in 1802 and operated until 1939. Since 2003 the Jail has been a popular with tourists as well as television. It has been featured in a variety of television shows including The Travel Channel, The Food Network, Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, and Ghost Brothers. </p>>

        <h2>Milaca, Minnesota</h2>
        <p>Both sides of my family are from Milaca. My Grandparents on my moms side and my Grandma on my dads side all attended the same high school in Milaca. My parents also attended that same school for their middle school years while waiting for the new school to be built.</p>

        <h2>Yokato Air Base, Japan</h2>
        <p>I was pretty young when i lived in Japan and have very few memories from being there. One memory I do have is from being at The Cherry Blossom Festival. Japan is known around the world for its cherry blossom festivals. Known as hanami in Japanese, cherry blossom festivals are an important custom and are held all over Japan during the spring. </p>

        <h2>Anderson Air Base, Guam</h2>
        <p>We lived on Anderson Air Base in Guam from January 1995 until January of 1997. Guam is a small island which means not many things to do, we spent most of our time at the beach. We spent most of our time at Tarague Beach which is located right on base. The landscape at Tarague consists of the sea and coral reef, the lagoon and coastal plain, a limestone beach and towering limestone cliff.</p>

        <h2>Little Rock, Arkansas</h2>
        <p>Arkansas may sound like a lame place to lived but it actually has a lot of offer. The Old Mill was one of my person favorites to visit. The Old Mill is famous for the opening scene in the movie, "Gone With The Wind", made in 1939. (It is believed to be the only remaining structure from the film.) This three-acre site, officially known as the T.R. Pugh Memorial Park and Pugh's Mill, is more commonly known as the Old Mill.</p>

        <h2>Anchorage, Alaska</h2>
        <p>Of all the places i've lived Alaska is still my all time favorite. As you can imagine, Hiking is a big thing. My favorite place to hike is Thundrbird Falls. It has a hiking trail that is 1.8 miles long, that almost anyone can hike up. I have never used the actual trail and always went the more dangerous way of hiking along the river. Alaska State Troopers highly recommend not going off the trail as i can be extremely dangerous and very hard to rescue someone if they do get hurt or fall. Being a teenager you tend not to think of things like that. </p>

        <h2>Mascoutah, Illinois</h2>
        <p>We moved to Mascoutah Illinois August 2006. Moving to a new place as sixteen was extremely hard, espically moving from a place with an amazing view of mountains to a place with a never ending view of corn and soy beans. So much has changed in the past tweleve years living here. The random girl, that i blew off, in the lunch line that tried to welcome my brother and I to the town is now my best friend. I married into a farm family and now love the never ending view of corn in the fall. I finally have the land to own as many animals as i want, the result being three dogs and two cats. I have a daughter named Rylee and a step-son named Michael. I built a life in the town i hatest the most and i'm loving every minute of it. </p>
